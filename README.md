# DSS/Worldie Project

Rescue Social Inc, also known as Worldie â€” Social Media for Good, is an organization dedicated to helping victims and witnesses of sexual assault, other misconduct, and cover-ups thereof in the film, music, and arts industries in demonstrating these abuses and legislating against them. At the DSS/Worldie partnership project, we are teaming up with Worldie to demonstrate the online harassment and media manipulation against victims by performing data scraping and sentiment analysis upon 500+ case articles, illustrating how victims and their interests are routinely marginalized and ignored. To improve our analytical efficacy, a key part of this project will be researching and applying different sentiment analysis tools and libraries so we can understand and analyze as much of said case articles as possible. Moreover, by examining how different groups are treated in the article dataset, we will highlight the role of misogyny and celebrity status in exacerbating the subjugation of female victims without the fame or fortune to resist the onslaught that perpetrators and far more powerful actors levy against them. We will also assess how different publications, particularly those involved with American Media, Inc. (AMI), now known as A360 Media, are more active in this marignalization than others.
